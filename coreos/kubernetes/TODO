on some etcd node, on a new setup:
etcdctl set /coreos.com/network/config '{ "Network": "10.1.0.0/16" }'

setting up kubectl(?)

cluster-ip... whats that? configured by me, is not valid
core@kubernetes-master ~ $ kubectl get services
NAME         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   10.254.254.1   <none>        443/TCP   1h

worker should be a "countable" resource. with dhcp.
within worker, $advertise_ip should be COREOS_PRIVATE_IPV4, which must be created by the(tm) hack.

front-/back-nodes:
To be able to schedule stuff to external reachable nodes

missing
* dns
* calico (â€¦ do not need(?))
