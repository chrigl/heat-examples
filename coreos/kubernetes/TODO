# on some etcd node, on a new setup:
etcdctl set /coreos.com/network/config '{ "Network": "10.1.0.0/16" }'

Using vxlan does not include the flanneld to encapsulate the traffic, but the kernel will do. This may be a bit more performant.
etcdctl set /coreos.com/network/config '{ "Network": "10.1.0.0/16", "Backend": { "Type": "vxlan" } }'

host-gw is unfortunately not usable, because the underlying network in openstack, only routes traffic from known mac addresses.

## Answer

Exporting the api. So the setup can be on the users computer.
The cert only includes the DNS name "kubernetes-master". So you have to add this, with the associated floating ip, into your /etc/hosts

# cluster-ip... whats that? configured by me, is not valid
core@kubernetes-master ~ $ kubectl get services
NAME         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   10.254.254.1   <none>        443/TCP   1h
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^(?)

## Answer

Exposed services are listening on this addresses.
http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/

These are available from all nodes.

Changed to 10.3.0.0/24

# Create namespace "kube-system"
ERROR: namespaces "kube-system" not found
http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/namespaces/

## Answer

Currently, this must be done by hand after the bootstrap.
kubectl create namespace kube-system

After a while, the kubernetes pods show up there.
kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system

# External IPs
To be able to schedule stuff to external reachable nodes.
Or to route stuff to external nodes to some pod.

## Answer

So far, the Sys11Stack (OpenStack) does not support LBaaS. This means, it is not possible to use External Load Balancer. The only way, I got "public" services, is the usage of "NodePort". With the drawback, that a custom port is diced. But the service is available over each public ip on this port.

kubectl expose rc webserver-rc --port=30001 --target-port=80 --type=NodePort

# Multi Master Setup

service ip for internal communication

# Per worker tls certs

optional

# Networking

* split network to management network with etcd?
* Hard coded ips for etcd, may result in duplication of OS::Nova::Server, instead of using a count on a resource group

# missing
* dns (https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/deploy-addons.html)
* calico (â€¦ do not need(?))
